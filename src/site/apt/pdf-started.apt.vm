Getting Started

* Install

	Java Prolog Interface API is distributed with implementation adapter 
	and concrete prolog driver library until it is possible according to 
	related libraries licenses. The distributions are named normally such 
	that <<prolobjectlink-jpi-jpl7-swi7-x.y.z-dist.zip>> meaning that this 
	distribution is a JPI implementation over JPL version 7 or above and
	SWI-Prolog version 7 or above. The x.y.z is the distribution version.
	The distribution can be downloaded in zip or tar.gz compresses format.
	To install you need perform the following steps:
	
	  * Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8 or above.
	  
	  * Install Native Prolog Engine compatible to Operating
        System and your architecture. If the Prolog Engine to
        use is Java-based this step is omitted.
      
      * Configure System Path with Prolog Engine routes.
        If the Prolog Engine to use is Java-based this step
        is omitted.
        
      * Download Java Prolog Interface compatible to 
        related prolog engine and unzip the distribution
        over Operating File System.
        
      * Configure System Path with JPI unzip folder route.
      
      * Open a new System console and type pllink –i 
        to see the product information.
        
	For the JPI beginners we recommended start with a Pure Java-Prolog
	Engine because have less configuration aspects and native engine
	are more difficult to link.

* Directories

	After download and unzip JPI distribution in the final JPI folder 
	you will see the following structure:
	
*----------------*---------------------------*
 Folder/File     | Description
*----------------*---------------------------*
 bin             | Binaries scripts
*----------------*---------------------------*
 docs             | Documentation
*----------------*---------------------------*
 prt            | Prolog programs files
*----------------*---------------------------*
 lib             | Library jars files
*----------------*---------------------------*
 obj             | Programs to link native engine procedures
*----------------*---------------------------*
 src             | Adapter source folder
*----------------*---------------------------*
 CONTRIBUTING    | Binaries scripts
*----------------*---------------------------*
 LICENSE         | Binaries scripts
*----------------*---------------------------*
 NOTICE          | Binaries scripts
*----------------*---------------------------*
 README          | Binaries scripts
*----------------*---------------------------*

* Architecture

	In general way and in bottom-up order the JPI architecture is composed 
	by the guest Operating System at low level. Over this level we find 
	compatible with guest Operating System and Native Prolog Engines 
	implementations. Over this level we find Pure Java Prolog Engine 
	implementations and Java Driver libraries to Native Prolog Engine. 
	Over this layer is the JPI interface adapter implementation for your 
	correspondent Java Prolog Driver. In the top level we find a User 
	Application that use the JPI interface.

* Getting started Java to Prolog

	After installation and architecture compression you can use the 
	hello world sample for test the system integration. This hello 
	world sample show how interacts with JPI from Java programming 
	language with Abstracted Prolog Engine. For the first experience 
	we suggesting use a Java-based Prolog engine like tuProlog because
	have less configuration aspects.
	
	Create in your preferred development environment an empty project.
	Set in the project build path the JPI downloaded libraries located
	at lib folder. Create a Main Java class that look like below code:
	
+------------------------------------------------------------+
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		PrologProvider provider = Prolog.
			getProvider(XsbProlog.class);
		PrologEngine engine = provider.newEngine();
		engine.asserta("sample('hello wolrd')");
		PrologQuery query=engine.query("sample(X)");
		System.out.println(query.one());
	}

}
